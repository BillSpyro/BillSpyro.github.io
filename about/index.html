      <h3>
        Life
      </h3>

      <p>
        Ever since I was around 7 we had a personal computer in our
        house. But at first my family mostly used it for buisness, my dad used
        it for his concrete buisness, but then they allowed me and my sister to
        eventually use the computer. I had only just watched youtube for a time
        until I started picking up on things and self learning as I go. I
        started figuring out how to mess with files, download files, etc and
        became quite fuilent navigating and modifying our computer.
        So that is basically the start of how I became interested in computers
        and wanted to go into a field that deals with them. Programming was one
        thing that really interested me after I got familer with our computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've dabbled in many different things for a while on computers like
        Blender, Java, Unreal Engine, and now I'm taking a college course that
        will focus soley on programming which is one of the things that most
        interests me when dealing with computers. How to make something work
        exactly the way you want it too.
