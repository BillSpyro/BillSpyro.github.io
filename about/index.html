          Life
        </h3>

        <p>
          Ever since I was around 7 we had a personal computer in our
          house, But at first my family mostly used it for buisness. My dad used
          the computer for his concrete buisness, but then they allowed me and my sister to
          use the computer. I only watched youtube until I started picking up on code and
          self learning as I went. I started figuring out how to mess with files, download
          files, etc and became quite skilled at navigating and modifying our computer.
          My path through youtube is basically the start of how I became interested in computers
          Programming was the main factor that got me interested in CSET after I got familer
          with our computer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've dabbled in many different programs for a while on computers like
          Blender, Java, Unreal Engine, and now I'm taking a college course that
          will focus soley on programming. Programming is one of the most interesting
          things that I have dealt with, when it comes to computers. Programming is
          a game of making something work exactly the way you want it too.

        <p>
          Politically I see my self as Third Party, as I don't really have a
          side. But I take in account that both sides have their own benefits
          and problems.
