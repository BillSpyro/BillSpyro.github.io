            Here you can see the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fnxceqco4rfobjm/AAB0rafMCGNDZWjEA7MzU-z3a?dl=0">
              Dropbox</a> link for all of my Java programs, you can download them
            and run them. Just make sure you use Netbeans.
          </p>

          <p>
            These are the largest Java programs, I made while in senior year.
            The programs are Pitt Programs which are the programs that the University
            of Pitt had assigned our class to do to prove that we knew how to use
            Java.

          <p>
            This is a simple java program that simulates a basic shop. It is Harry
            Potter themed, there is only text, and no GUI. There is also a discount
            for some items if you can get the password right. It also features a way to
            give back your change if you over pay. Feel free to download and
            give it a try <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ifdzouk7b7c0vsj/AADbVDPcstymd6UwoMRmXKAGa?dl=0">here</a>.

          <img src="images/PittProgram2.png" alt="Image of a java program" />

          <p>
            This is a simple word game. You are given a word and you must make words out
            of that same word. It is timed for 60 seconds. There is an ID system that
            somewhat saves your progress. Feel free to download and give it a try
            <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jhsfr9kz8bkxpky/AACEIhGlW9hGNTCnN7DRC97La?dl=0">here</a>.

          <p>
            This is the same as the word game program but with the offical addition of
            saving your stats. There is a player file which contains all of the players
            and from within the program you can create a new player and give it a password
            Make sure you remember your password because it only gives you two chances
            to put in that said password. Feel free to download and give it a try
            <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tfb7sh25c6c7dus/AADHxM9yuGKtkaYrXozyUxmHa?dl=0">here</a>.

          <img src="images/PittProgram4.png" alt="Image of a java program" />

          <p>
            This is the last version of the word game program and now it features a nice
            GUI interface for the entire game. There is a simple start menu where you
            can log in as a player to start or quit. This program doesn't feature the player
            creation, so if you want to create a player, you must edit the player file.
            The game screen also features sorting for found and guessed words. You can
            also select next word to move on to the next word. Quiting will display your
            stats for that game. Feel free to download and give it a try
            <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/23ex3xfquu26mhl/AAC58fBEMcsdiIfbZ44rFpPka?dl=0">here</a>.
